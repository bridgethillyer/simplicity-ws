# The Simplicity of Clojure

## Outline

### Welcome
* Agenda overview

### Clojure Overview and REPL
* Why Clojure?
* REPL
* Syntax 
  * Literals (one slide)

### Collections
* Possible theme: board games - model this (or something else)
* About
    * Immutability
    * Go under the hood with immutability -- how is it not a memory hog?
* Types 
    * Vectors
    * Lists 
    * Maps - look at examples in Thinking in Data for this
    * Sets

#### Sequences
* Sequence abstractions

#### Modeling 
* Model a Board Game exercise
    
### Functions
* Call a function
* Let
* Define a function
* Higher order functions
  * map
  * reduce    
    
### Protocols
* Show how you can add sequence abstractions

### Flow Control (2 slides)
* Truthiness
* cond
* if
* loop
* doseq 

### State
* Vars
* Atoms
* Refs
* Agents 

### Example projects
* Example 1
* Example 2

### Bonus Material

#### Concurrency 
* Futures

#### Program Organization

## Notes on themes
_How is Clojure simple?_

* Syntax is small
* Values instead of objects with state
* Functions instead of methods to manipulate state
* Managed refs instead of variables
* Maps to represent data instead of special syntax/classes
  * Generic data processing
  * Data as data
* Declarative instead of imperative


## TODO Moved to: [Issues](https://github.com/bridgethillyer/simplicity-ws/issues) 

* Research one project each that we can use to highlight/use for examples
* DONE Start slides
* DONE Create github repository
* DONE - See [Issues](https://github.com/bridgethillyer/simplicity-ws/issues) Create issues for TODOs in github
